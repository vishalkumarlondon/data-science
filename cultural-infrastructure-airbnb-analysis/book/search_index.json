The aim of this research is to empirically capture the impact of cultural infrastructure on neighbourhoods in London by leveraging multilinear, spatial lag and geographically weighted regression models. Code by MacLachlan and Dennett (2019), Claus O. Wilke (2019), and Jason Zivkovic (2019) have been very helpful and have been referenced thoroughly throughout. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction To date, very few academic papers - except for Campin &amp; Marshall’s (2017) UCL Laboratory report on LGBT cultural infrastructure - have researched the impact of cultural infrastructure in London, let alone approach the debate with quantitative reasoning. In particular, there has been a dearth of geospatial analysis in the CCI as noted by Bakhshi, Lee &amp; Mateos-Garcia (2014). Increased access to data and computational and statistical tools for econometrics and spatial data science offers a solution to articulate in more detail the value and impact of art and culture in London and, when applied to digital humanities and cultural data, is leading to a new discipline: cultural data science. The aim of this research is to empirically capture the impact of cultural infrastructure on neighbourhoods in London by leveraging multilinear, spatial lag and geographically weighted regression models. Data from the GLA’s Cultural Infrastructure Map provides information on over 10,000 cultural venues in London and over 240,000 Airbnb data points from Inside Airbnb are used as a proxy for the supply (the number of Airbnb listings supplied by hosts) and demand (the number of reviews given by visitors) of economic activity in neighbourhoods. Furthermore, user-generated ratings and reviews from the Google Place API are utilised as proxies for sociocultural activity. This study presents a unique way of measuring the impact of cultural infrastructure on local economies in London; although, it is acknowledged that other indicators of the local economy, such as the business density, retail stores and residential development, should be considered in future research. The initial findings of this study conclude that increased density of cultural infrastructure in a neighbourhood positively contributes to both the supply and demand of Airbnb listings. Moreover, the attractiveness of the cultural infrastructure contributes to a multiplier effect. This study will be important for urban planners, construction companies and policy makers who want to empirically and spatially understand the effect that cultural infrastructure has on a local economy. However, the debate is much more nuanced and there are several limitations of this study that are considered and that could be overcome with additional data and further research. "],

Download Airbnb data I collected every Airbnb “listings.csv” file for London from the website Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for the years 2017 and 2018, concatinated them all together and put it here (github link) on this project’s GitHub repo.

Rather, it averages out the price for each unique listing (by id) between 2017 and 2018. By doing this, adjustments for natural fluctations - for instance, seasonality - are averaged out. Future research may study dive deeper into the differences in price across time and season. #----create a new dataframe by grouping the listings id and creating an average price column price_average &lt;- airbnb %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% summarise(price = mean(price)) colnames(price_average) &lt;- c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;price_average&quot;) #----join the new dataframe to the original Airbnb data to add a column for the average price per listing between 2017 and 2018 airbnb &lt;- inner_join(airbnb, price_average, by = c(&#39;id&#39;)) #----keep the original Airbnb data my making a `airbnb_old` dataframe airbnb_old &lt;- airbnb #----remove unnecessary columns and remove duplicate listing ids to leave unique listings with average price between 2017 and 2018 #airbnb &lt;- airbnb[, ! colnames(airbnb) %in% c(&quot;price&quot;, &quot;last_review&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;)] airbnb &lt;- airbnb[, ! colnames(airbnb) %in% c(&quot;price&quot;)] airbnb &lt;- airbnb[!duplicated(airbnb[c(&quot;id&quot;)]),] #----turn Airbnb datafram into an sf airbnb &lt;- st_as_sf(airbnb, coords = c(&quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;), crs = 4326) airbnb &lt;- st_transform(airbnb, 27700) At this stage, outliers in price are removed, this is because the average price for some listings went as high as £10,000.

Download Cultural Infrastructure data I collected data for every cultural venue in London by borough from data.london.gov (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/cultural-infrastructure-map). Specifically, the “Cultural venues by London borough” zip file was downloaded and then all the files were concatinated. In total there were 10,003 cultural venues in London. This entire dataset was then passed to the Google Places API to calculate the average user rating and total number of reviews for each venue. The total run time to recieve a ratings and reviews took 90 minutes, which is why it was much more efficient to calculated these metrics outside of this R script. For more information on the Google Place API, please visit this link (X) 1,958 venues out of the 10,003 total did not possess any, or had zero, user ratings and reviews on Google Places and were therefore dropped leaving 8,045 venues remaining for the analysis. #----read in the Cultural Infrastructure data from porject GitHubb culture &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/all-cultural-infra-map-google-places.csv&quot;) print(dim(culture)) ## [1] 10003 25 print(colSums(is.na(culture))) ## BOROUGH Cultural.Venue.Type site_name address1 ## 0 0 0 0 ## address2 address3 borough_code borough_name ## 0 0 0 0 ## latitude longitude easting northing ## 0 0 0 0 ## os_addressbase_uprn ward_2018_code ward_2018_name website ## 4273 0 0 0 ## gss_code runtime API_response formatted_address ## 0 0 0 0 ## name place_id rating types ## 0 0 1556 0 ## user_ratings_total ## 1556 print(dim(culture[culture$rating == 0, ])) ## [1] 1958 25 #----only keep rows from Cultural Infrastructure if the longitude cell is filled in (i.e. not Null) culture &lt;- culture[complete.cases(culture$longitude), ] #----only keep rows from Cultural Infrastructure if the rating cell is filled in (i.e. not Null) culture &lt;- culture[!is.na(as.numeric(as.character(culture$rating))),] #----only keep rows from Cultural Infrastructure if the rating cell is not 0 culture &lt;- culture[culture$rating != 0, ] #----turn the Cultural Infrastructure dataframe into an sf object culture &lt;- st_as_sf(culture, coords = c(&quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;), crs = 4326) culture &lt;- st_transform(culture, 27700) #culture_withPubs &lt;- culture #culture &lt;- culture[!culture$Cultural.Venue.Type == &#39;Pubs&#39;,] 3.
